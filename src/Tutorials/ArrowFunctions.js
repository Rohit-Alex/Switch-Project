/*  
    * 1> New feature introduced in ES6
    * 2> Provides a shorter syntax for defining functions compared to traditional function expressions.
    * 3> If only one parameter is there then no need of paranthesis as well.
    * 4> Can defined a function without the need of "function" keyword.
    * 5> Can return a value without "return" keyword and curly braces. Provided function content is 1 line.
    * 6> Arrow functions have a lexical scoping, which means that they use the value of variables from the enclosing scope where they are defined, 
        not where they are executed.
