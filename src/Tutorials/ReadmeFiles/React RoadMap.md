lifecycle methods

DOMContentLoaded => The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the HTML document has been completely parsed, and all deferred scripts (<script defer src="â€¦"> and <script type="module">) have downloaded and executed. It doesn't wait for other things like images, subframes, and async scripts to finish loading.
componentDidMount is triggered as soon as the instance of the componenet is created. Wheras, DOMContentLoaded is fired once only in entire webPage life.
